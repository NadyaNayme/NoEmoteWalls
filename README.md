# NoEmoteWalls

Because sometimes you want to see when people emote you without seeing when people emote one another.

## Settings

* Hide emote text if not targeted at you
* Hide emote text not targeted at anyone in particular


## Known Issues

* Some emotes still go through. File an issue with the emote text and I'll get it blocked.
